READ ME file for the template of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data

1.
Create a folder with the raw data (fastq files)
Save DADA2_PairedReads.Rmd file in the folder

2. 
Start with the DADA2 pipeline
Once completed, be sure to have the correct file saved in the folder

3. 
Use 16S_table_to_phyloseq to obtain the code to start your analysis
This code can be copy and paste in your analysis R script
At the end of this pipeline you will have a phyloseq object that can be used for analysis

4. 
Analysis!
Example of analysis and processing before analysis can be found in the 16S_analysis.Rmd
The code can be copy and paste below the 16S_table_to_phyloseq code in your R script

Good luck!
